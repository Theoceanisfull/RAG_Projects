# 🧠 Basic RAG Project with LangChain

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/). The project demonstrates how to build a question-answering system that augments a Large Language Model (LLM) with document retrieval and a vector database.

- 🔎 **Vector Store** – FAISS-based vector index for fast similarity search  
- 🤖 **LLM Integration** – OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, or any LangChain-compatible model  
- 🧪 **Question Answering** – Ask questions and receive context-aware responses from your documents
